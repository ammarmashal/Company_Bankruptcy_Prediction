# Company_Bankruptcy_Prediction

Company Bankruptcy Prediction
Bankruptcy data from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999â€“2009

My job is to classify corporate bankruptcy.

In this project, I deal with many things:
1- High Skewed Data
2- multicollinearity
3- Outliers
4- Imbalanced data


I used professional techniques in building the model :
1-Decision Tree Classifier
2- Random Forest Classifier
3-Gradient Boosting Classifier
4- use GridSearchCV to get the best parameters
5- Hyperparameter tuning
6-RandomOverSampler
7-RandomUnderSampler
8-confusion_matrix
9-precision recall




-I wish you read my project and let me comments with advice to approve my code and score
